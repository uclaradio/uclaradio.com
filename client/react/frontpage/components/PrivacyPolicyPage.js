      It is UCLA Radio's policy to respect your privacy regarding any
      information we may collect while operating our website. This Privacy
      Policy applies to <a href="http://uclaradio.com">uclaradio.com</a>{' '}
      (hereinafter, "us", "we", or "uclaradio.com"). We respect your privacy and
      are committed to protecting personally identifiable information you may
      provide us through the Website. We have adopted this privacy policy
      ("Privacy Policy") to explain what information may be collected on our
      Website, how we use this information, and under what circumstances we may
      disclose the information to third parties. This Privacy Policy applies

    </p>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy, together with the Terms and conditions posted on our
      Website, set forth the general rules and policies governing your use of

      may be required to agree to additional terms and conditions.
    </p>
    <h2>Website Visitors</h2>
    <p>
      Like most website operators, UCLA Radio collects
      non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and
      servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language
      preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request.
      UCLA Radio's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information
      is to better understand how UCLA Radio's visitors use its website. From
      time to time, UCLA Radio may release non-personally-identifying
      information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in
      the usage of its website.
    </p>
    <p>
      UCLA Radio also collects potentially personally-identifying information
      like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users
      leaving comments on http://uclaradio.com blog posts. UCLA Radio only
      discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same
      circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying
      information as described below.
    </p>
    <h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
    <p>
      Certain visitors to UCLA Radio's websites choose to interact with UCLA
      Radio in ways that require UCLA Radio to gather personally-identifying
      information. The amount and type of information that UCLA Radio gathers
      depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who
      sign up for a blog at http://uclaradio.com to provide a username and email
      address.
    </p>
    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
      The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember
      that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic
      storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable
      means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its
      absolute security.
    </p>
    <h2>Links To External Sites</h2>
    <p>
      Our Service may contain links to external sites that are not operated by
      us. If you click on a third party link, you will be directed to that third
      party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy and
      terms and conditions of every site you visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for the content,
      privacy policies or practices of any third party sites, products or
      services.
    </p>
    <h2>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
    <p>
      UCLA Radio discloses potentially personally-identifying and
      personally-identifying information only to those of its employees,
      contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that
      information in order to process it on UCLA Radio's behalf or to provide
      services available at UCLA Radio's website, and (ii) that have agreed not
      to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and
      affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by
      using UCLA Radio's website, you consent to the transfer of such
      information to them. UCLA Radio will not rent or sell potentially
      personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone.
      Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as
      described above, UCLA Radio discloses potentially personally-identifying
      and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena,
      court order or other governmental request, or when UCLA Radio believes in
      good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property
      or rights of UCLA Radio, third parties or the public at large.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are a registered user of http://uclaradio.com and have supplied
      your email address, UCLA Radio may occasionally send you an email to tell
      you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date
      with what's going on with UCLA Radio and our products. We primarily use
      our blog to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep
      this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via
      a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the
      right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request
      or to help us support other users. UCLA Radio takes all measures
      reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use,
      alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and
      personally-identifying information.
